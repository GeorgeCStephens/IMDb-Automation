# IMDb-Automation
A test automation framework and subsequent suite designed to automate the testing of functional features of IMDb (https://www.imdb.com/)

## Purpose of this project
This project has been created purely to demonstrate and learn Test Automation concepts, ideas and design patterns.
Test cases have been generated by ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com) and hand selected by myself due to their capacity to be automated. See `Test Cases.md` for more information

## The goal of this project startin out
I will create core functionality to perform 'high level user actions' within IMDb in a re-usable and maintainble framework.
From this framework I will create specific test cases that can be ran in executed to functionally test the site. The comprehensive selection of such test cases will be compiled into a 'test suite'.

## Potential expansion of this project
This project will initally be created in Python. For further expansion of knowledge and variety, the framework created will be converted into Java and C# respectively.

## Final notes
I do not own IMDb nor have any affiliation with the site.
I will add sufficent waits within my code as to not disrupt the sites performance for other users.
If this project requires to be discountued by IMDb then reach out to my email and it will be done so with haste: georgecampbellstephens@gmail.com. 
All code created is free to use and replicate by anyone.
